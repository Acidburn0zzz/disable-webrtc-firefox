Disable WebRTC, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-disable-webrtc/)

Hide in the forest, with WebRTC cleanly disabled.

Why did I make this plugin? A friend of mine pointed out that with WebRTC, your local IP is exposed, without user interaction. https://hacking.ventures/local-ip-discovery-with-html5-webrtc-security-and-privacy-risk/

If you don't find yourself using WebRTC, this plugin provides an easy way to enable/disable it.

Feel free to make a GitHub issue, or pull request. Thanks.
